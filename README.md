# website
Website that documents the API

## Running the website locally

### 1. Check if you have Node.js
run `node --version`.

If you do not have Node.js you can install it using `nvm`:
1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).
2. Install the version needed for this project, run `nvm install`.

Note if you've already installed this version in the past you can switch to the correct version by running `nvm use`.

You may not need to do this step depending on the version of Node.js you have installed.

### 2. Install the dependencies
run `npm install`.

### 3. Start the project
run `npm start`.

You should now be able to see a version of the website running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000}).

## Deploying the website
The website is automatically deployed to [whatfoodbanksneed.netlify.com](https://whatfoodbanksneed.netlify.com) when ever this repository is updated.
